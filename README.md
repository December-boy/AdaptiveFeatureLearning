"Tracking Persons-of-Interest via Adaptive Discriminative Features", in Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.

We take the T-ara sequence as an example to evaluate our adaptive feature learning approach in this code. Our learned model on the T-ara sequence can be found here:
